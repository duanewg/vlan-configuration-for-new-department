# VLAN Implementation for Broadband Cost Reduction
When this non-profit organization first established, there was only one office.  As the organization grew, it added a technology lab and another department.  In order to meet the demands of the two departments and the users of the technogy lab, broadband accounts were set up at all three locations.    

The broadband connections were consolidated and VLANs were implemented to optimize network resources, reduce costs, and improve overall network efficiency.
